To start, first run the pywriter.py file after installing the required libraries.
After the .py file put the cursor in the ide window from where you want to start typing.
And now speak the commands in microphone wait for the command to complete and
it will write code on window according to the command given.




Commands:-
i=55---------initialise/add a integer i and speak integer number in second command like "55"
i="hey"----------initialise/add a string i and string name in second command like "string hey"
i=[1,2,3]----------initialise/add a list i and speak the content in second command like "1 2 3"
while i<9 ------insert or create a while loop and speak condition in second command like "i less than 8"

for i in range(1,200,2):---------insert or create a for loop i from 1 to 200 (with a gap of 2)(optional)
for i in n:----------------------insert or create a for loop i on n


if -----------"insert/create if condition" and in second command speak condition after it
elif---------- "insert/create else if "  and in second command speak condition after it
else----------  "insert/create else  condition"    

def ram(on,pop)------"create/insert function ram" and in second command speak parameter(optional) after it if there are like "on pop"

ram(on,pop)----------"call function ram" and in second command speak the parameters(optional) after it if there are like "on pop"





Note-:
----where it is written "in second command" it means you have to wait to finish first command
----it is litttle slow so be patient
----to add string somewhere say string then the sentence or word to write as string
    Example-:after if in second commad you say "string this is even number"
    then output will be :
                if "this is even number"
-----to add operators say there name like modulus for % 
                                          multiply for *
                                          power for **
----Wait ten second to speak a thing again if it has not printed on the screen.
----Most imp if you completed with your line you have to say "next line" to go to another line
----to come out from loop or if conditions say finish loop/finish if condition/finish this if condition  
----to run the file say run file/run it etc.
